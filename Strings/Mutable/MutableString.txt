So previously we read that why strings in java are immutable so we need something to make them mutable in case we need
mutability and that comes with string buffer and string builder classes in java.

The only differnce between string buffer and string builder is that string buffer is thread safe whereas string builder 
is not thread safe.

StringBuffer str = new StringBuffer("Gaurav");
StringBuilder str1 = new StringBuilder("Gaurav");

Clearly we have created two reference varibales str and str1 which will be storing the object address that will be created
in the heap memeory.

In String buffer there is always a buffer capacity of 16 which it provides to us and once its reached
it will double that , a similar kind of dynamic array.

Ex: StringBuffer 
str = new StringBuffer("");
str.capacity()

So it will be 16 now say 
str.append("GauravGauravGaurav");
System.out.println(str.capacity());

Now capacity will be doubled to 32 now as initial capacity limit we have reached.

similar In String builder there is always a buffer capacity of 22 which it provides to us and once its reached
it will double that , a similar kind of dynamic array.

StringBuilder str1 = new StringBuilder("Gaurav");
System.out.println(str1.capacity());
str1.append("GauravGauravGauravGaurav");
System.out.println(str1.capacity());
