Just like we have talked about abstract classes i,e classes which have 0 or more abstract methods and we cant create
object of these classes.

Now coming to an example where every method is abstract then we can use an interface instead of an abstract class.

So an interface will have

1- All abstract methods: i,e methods only declared not defined and they will be public abstract by default
2- All instance varibales will be final and static

Since you can't create an object of interface so these instance varibales should never be object dependent and thus
they have to be static and final by default.

If a class implements an interface than it must define all the declared methods of that interface.

If a inteface extends another inteface than all the methods declared in that inteface will be by default marked as 
decalred also in the interface whhich is extending it.

A class can implement multiple interfaces.
