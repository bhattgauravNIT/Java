In java there are some primitive dataTypes, primitive in the sense they are not objects and nethier they are classes, 
so it will be right to say that these are simply dataType like in any other language and thus java is not 100% objects
oriented.

If i say 

int num = 4.

So it create me a num varibale of type int with a value 4 and there num varibale is a primitive varibale and not a reference
varibale as its not storing any refernce of object in heap.

However java provides liverage to wrap any primitive datatype as a class object and even to wrap any class object into a 
primitive datatype.

This wrapping of primitive dataType to an class object is class boxing and such classObjects to which a primitive datatype
is being wrapped upon are called wrapper classes.

Ex: 

Primitive               Wrapper class

int                      Integer
double                   double
float                    float
boolean                  Boolean.


When java takes care of this wrapping and unwrapping automatically such situations arte known as autoBoxing and autoUnboxing.
