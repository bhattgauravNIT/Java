At top we have object class then we have throwable class

                                       object
                                         |
                                      throwable
                                     ____|______
                    Error                            Exceptions
                                                        |   (Run time exception)                 | (sql exceptions)
                1. I/O Error                         1. Airthmetic exceptions
                2. MemeoryLimit Error                2. Null pointer exceptions
                3. DeadThreadError                   3. Array out of bound exception


All exceptions extends exception class.

So exceptions all have various kinds of exceptions like runTime or sqlException.

ALl run time exceptions falls under unchecked category where as others like sql exceptions etc falls under checked category.

So unchecked are those which are not necessary to be handled however check exceaptions like sql exceptions falls under
checked exception categpry and thus they need to be handled compulsarily at all cost.
