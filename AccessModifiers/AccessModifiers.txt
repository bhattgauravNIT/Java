There are 4 access modifiers namely

1. Deafult
2. Private
3. Public
4. Protected

Say ex:


1. public class A {
     int name;
}

Since we have not mentioned anything its by default a default access modifier and it can be accessed in the same package.
So all the files (java files) which are in the same package can have access to this name once they create an object of class A.


2. Private

public class A {
    private name;
}

Now this private varibale will only have access in the same class rest no where.

3. Public 

public class A {
    public name;
}

This public varibale will have access everywhere that is even from other packages.

4. Protected

public class A{
    protected name;
}

This protected varibale will only have access in the subClasses.
