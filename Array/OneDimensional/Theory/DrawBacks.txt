Array in java are very good but there are some drawbacks.

1.Suppose i have created a int type array but i want to store strings as well along with int and say float and booleans as well
this is not possible with arrays.

2. Supoose i have created a array of size 4 using int arr[] = new int[4].

As soon as a new keyword is used it resembles an object and arr will be the refrence varibale stored in stack of function'
and pointing towrds this array which will get created in the heap memory.

So once a size is initialized we cant exceed it and it make it static sized array and thus it poses a disadvantage.
