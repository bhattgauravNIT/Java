Java works on concept of packages. Ex: 

If we look at folder structure of Oops for Inheritance folder its

JAVA-> Oops -> Inheritance -> 2 classes (Calculator & AdvancedCalculator)

So if we want to create an object of say Calculator.java we need to have it imported from package i,Ex


package JAVA.Oops.Inheritance.Calculator

similarily if we want to create or use AdvancedCalculator we need to import it like.

package JAVA.Oops.Inheritance.AdvancedCalculator


Now in case if we want all the files inside a folder we can use a short hand like:

package JAVA.Oops.Inheritance.*

This short hand is applicable for all files inside a folder and not all folders inside a folder.

Now in java everything is within a package.

Ex: System.out.println

System is also a part of package as its a class thus we need to take it from a package.

Bydeafult package java.lang; is always imported for all .java files being created and thus this System class is also coming
from there only.
