So basically there is a Hardware on top of that we have a os and on top of that we have our software.

In real life there are multiple softwares running at the same time for example we can see in task manager that multiple
softwares are running at same time.

This is called as multi Tasking.

Now in Hardware there is CPU which is responsible for all type of logical computation 
however lets say a software is running so it will run on OS so therefore if its requesting a thread for it it has to 
go through os and the os is responsible for schedling.

Say ex a request of 500 threads comes in , in which one software may be using one thread or multiple threads.

For ex: Vs code is one software but it can use multiple threads at same time for ex: we are typing as well as vs code'
is compiling simplutaneously and say throwing error on some syntax so it can use multiple threads.
Similarly chrome we are opening multiple tabs in it and one is youtube so laptop is now playing music even while
we are browing through other tabs so even chrome i,e a single software is using multiple threads.

Now coming back to schedling since we have an i7 this means our processor is capable of handling 7 threads
at a same time . 

So say the scheduler schedules 7 threads at same time and send them to CPU for processing but still 500-7 threads
is awaiting thus scheduler schedules them based on some time.

This is concepts of threads.
