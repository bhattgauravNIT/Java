So a thread during its entire life cycle has certain states which are know as thread states.

             new()
      New    ------->            (start())
                                 Runnable                          (wait(), sleep())
                                                                      Waiting   
 
                                 Running                        


                                                        (stop())
                                                          Dead


So these are the various stages of a thread.

1. New : When we create a thread its a new state for a thread. For example when we say Thread t1 = new Thread();

2. Runnable: When the thread is ready to run but its waiting for the scheduler to schedule it according to the traffic
and send it to the running state is called Runnable state.

3. When the thread reaches the CPU and is running in CPU is called running state.

4. Supoose after running for certain time in CPU it is being sent back to witing state as other threads also needs some 
time , this state is witing thread.

5. Once wait is over it goes back to runnable state where the scheduler of OS and schedules it and then send it to CPY in 
running state.

6. Once the task is over the thread stops and achieve dead state.
