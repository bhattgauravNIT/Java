Collection is an interface.

The hierarchy comes under like:


                                            Collection
                     Map                |             |                |       
                      HashMap           List         Set             Queue

                                  ArrayList    HashSet         Deque
                                  LinkedList                   PriorityQueue


So collection is an inteface now there are other iterfaces like List, Set, Queue which implements this inteface .

Collections however refers to classes which implements inteface like List, Set , Queue.


So In interfaces like list there exists classes which implements these interfaces like ArrayList, LinkedList.
For set its like HashSet,TreeSet etc.
For queue its like Deque, PriorityQueue.

A map is a inteface however it does not implements Collection inteface and thus its a kind of seperate inteface and the classes
implementing this interface is HashMap, TreeMap etc.
